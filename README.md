# Note #1
From me: for every my project I will create a note about difficulties that I faced and how I solved it.

## Keystrokes
For a very long time I tried to write a method, that print values of pressed key-numbers and key-operations. Nothing succeeded because when you press key on the first time, next presses repeated the first press due to focus on the element. In the next version tag `<button>` should be replaced by regular tag `<div>` and problem, probably, will be solved.

## Scope of Variables.
In the body of a method, the calling of the object's property with `this` does not work, cause you need to refer to the property with the name of the object and a dot.

## Favicons
Adding icons to the web-application is very eazy. I just have both left hands.
